Problem Description
You are given an integer A. You have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.

Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.

A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.



        Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 106



Input Format
First and only argument contains a single positive integer A.



Output Format
Return 1 if A is a perfect number and 0 otherwise.



        Example Input
Input 1:

A = 4
Input 2:

A = 6


Example Output
Output 1:

        0
Output 2:

        1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

        For A = 4, the sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 = 3, is not equal to 4.
Explanation 2:

        For A = 6, the sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, is equal to 6.
